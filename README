## uOneCrypt is NOT AN OFFICIAL UBUNTU SOFTWARE.  This software ##

This project is aimed to allow use Ubuntu One File storage using any OS and
allowing to crypt data in your local OS using your private key.

This is a wrapper of the Ubuntu REST API:
https://one.ubuntu.com/developer/files/store_files/cloud/ 
All you need is to fill the config file [uOne.cfg] and execute uOneCrypt.py

uOne.cfg has de following parameters:

[auth]
uone_user = your@email.address
uone_passwd = your@Ubuntu_one.password
key = passphrase (will be digested with sha256 to generate your private key)

- Software dependences are only Python >=2.6 and PyCrypto 
- Ecryption only works for files stored under /CRYPT

Each directory unter /CRYPT will have a .ToC file containing the names 
of the files and directories.

DON'T MODIFY ANY FILE INSIDE /CRYPT if you want to keep the filesystem consitent.

==============

-	PUT request
	[https://one.ubuntu.com/developer/files/store_files/cloud/#put_apifile_storagev1-directorycontent_path-filenameext-or-apifile_storagev1-filecontent_path]
	has a timeout problem, so that if you have a slow upload transfer rate
	your files won't be uploaded.  My upload rate transfer is 0.49Mbps
	(aprox 60Kb/s) and the largest file I can upload has a size of ~50-60 MB.
